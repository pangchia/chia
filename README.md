- 356.5 GB of temporary space
- 108.8 GB of final plot file will take

You really never need to plot a plot with a k size larger than 32

A k32 plot can be done by one expert we know in just under 4 hours 
but most experts are creating plots in 5 hours 
and most folks average around 9-12 hours.

The first phase generates all of your proofs of space by creating [  seven  ] tables of cryptographic hashes and saving them to your temporary directory

Getting going
The first phase generates all of your proofs of space by creating seven tables of cryptographic hashes and saving them to your temporary directory. 
Phase 2 back-propagates through the hashes,
phase 3 sorts and algorithmically compress these hashes in the temporary directory while starting to build the final file 
phase 4 completes the file and moves it into your final plot file.
